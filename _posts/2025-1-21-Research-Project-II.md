## What else the **Stgart** can do
In 2021, my senior Kai Otsuka figured out that **Stgart** is a regulator of steroidogenesis.
In the introduction part, we already know the steroidogenesis is taken place in the Leydig cells. 
I have worked on elucidating how **Stgart** regulates the steroidogenesis in the Leydig cells.
This work will be published in 2-3 months if I work more harder. Since *Stagrt* is maily expressed in the cytosol of Leydig cells, 
the hypothesis is **Stgart** does its job in the post-transcriptional level.
The expression of a chlosterol transport protein coding gene, *Star*, was increased in the **Stgart**-overexpressed TM3 cells whcih are derived from Leydig cells. The hypothesis is that **Stgart** might be invovled in some negative regulation mechanism of *Star* mRNA such as miRNA pathway.
With presence of **Stgart**, it can attract miRNAs which target *Star* mRNA, and then *Star* will be controled in the certain level.
Now I am verifying my miRNA candidates by mutating their target regions on the *Stagrt* and *Star* mRNA, checking the expression in the cell lines and doing some loss-of-function and gain-of -function tests.
