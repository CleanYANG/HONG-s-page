## Future research interests
# The structure fo RNA to its function.
Since I have worked on investigating the regulation of mRAN by miRAN via the lncRNA, some results are leading me to a very deep dimension.
I want to know how RNAs fold for fitting and recuiting different regulator despite they are RNA or proteins. 
How they change the folding strucutre during revolution of different species. 
Where the force come from to make them fold ? I am so interested in biophysics. 
I joined a samll biophysics er conference in July, 2024 at Sapporo. Most of topic is about the folding of protein, but one research reported the conformation changing of tRNA in the E.coli. 
Charming! I want to know a molecular from its structure, conformation to its phsiological function. A research should be done thoroughly like that. 
# Bioenergy 
I am thinking how to deal with human feces since I am a kid. I don't why I was concering this becasue I was just a kid lol. 
Maybe because I love nature and I want to keep it clean always. There is one idea in my mind relating to using biotechology to extract and transfer the waste becoming energy.
## I won't tell you now.
