My current project is working on investigating how long noncoding RNAs(lncRNAs) are functioning in the spermatogenesis of mice. First of all, we are going to introduction of my current research. 

## lncRNAs

Let's break down those terms. When we look at long noncoding RNAs, we are questioning 'how long they are?', obviously, they are not small as microRNAs whose length are just 21-23 nucleotides, micoRNAs are extremely short and they don't code protein of course,  but they are amazing players in the gene regulation, so Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won 2024 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine. Now you know next prize will go to.....(I am not implying anything here). Anyway, both microRNAs and lncRNAs are not coding proteins. lncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides and transcribed by polymerase II generally from intergenic regions (We all know protein-coding genes are from exons).This graph is showing very simple biogenesis of lncRNA. Simple than Tokyo subway guide.

## Spermatogenesis

Spermatogenesis. wow, it is a long term for God sake. It only tells one thing, the gene regulation during the formation of sperm in mice testes. That's it. Generating a healthy sperms are not easy for themselves. The graph here is showing the spermatogenesis. Preparing a boring explanation from here....In the mouse testes, there are many seminiferous tubules, within the tubules, the spermatogonia is undergoing self-renew and differentiation to maintain the number of itself and form the primary spermatocytes. This primary spermatocyte will give rise to spermatid eventually by meiosis. The shape of those cells are mostly round, flat or fusiform like a croissant.. (Don't hate me). Spermatids are going through final step, spermiogenesis, in a simple word, they change the shape, getting tails and packing all the genome information in the head.  Germ cells are luckier than most of us. They get two housekeepers. Leydig cells will go through steroidogenesis to produce testosterone outside of tubules and then Sertoli cells take it for regulating genes which are required for whole spermatogenesis. See, nothing is really complicate.

If sperms want to make it from this long journey, any genes or elements should be tightly regulated. One research presented a large-scale evolutionary study of 11 tetrapod species and identified approximately 11,00 primate-specific lncRNAs(doi:10.1038/nature12943), lncRNAs are showing testes-preferentially expression pattern and GO terms suggested lncNRA enriched in spermaotogenesis.

Do you want ot know What their ROLE are in the spermatogenesis now ? if you don't , alright, bye.
