## The function of **Stgart** is more than those.
One weired and complicate thing I have to tell you is , the expression of *Star* and other steroidogenic genes such as, *Hsd3b1* and *Cyp11a1* were increased in the *Stgart*-KO testis according to RNA-seq data. The expression of *Star* is actually increased in the **Stgart**-overexpressed cells.
This is conflicted with the hypothesis which assumes *Stgart* is a positive regulator of *Star*. What clues I have missed ?
## First, let's look through all the process of steroidogenesis.
LH hormone is released from pituitary and received by its receptor then activite a membrane protein, adenylate cyclase(AC). Then AC catalysis ATP to cAMP which activate Protein Kinase A(PKA) to trigger the activation *Star* protein. The transport and clevage of chosterol is happening on/in the mitochandria. Taking the notes here! The simulation of active *Star* protein needs ATP and part of steroidogenesis is taken place in the mitochandria.
Most ATP is systhesised from mitochandria. Clue is Mitochandria ! *Stgart* might be invovled the metobolism in the both Leydig cells and germ cells. Germ cells require energy to maintain the proliferation and maturation.

## 'Excellent !' I cried, 'Elementary'
Let's zoom in. What is happening in the mitochandria ?

The answer are Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and TCA cycle. The TCA cycle produces 3NADH and FADH2 which are part of source of reaction for complex I and complex II on the mitochandria. Complex V is responsible for synthesizing ATP and transporting them out of membrane. What if the potential of mitochandria and synthesis of ATP are affected in by deleting *Stgart*?
On the other hand, another energy provider, Glycolysis can't br overlooked. The glycolysis provide the Acetyl-CoA to TCA cycle. It's a cycle of life ! Ineed, the energy mechanism is dirupted by deleting *Stgart* from the RNA-seq data.

This is so much fun! Now I am working on this work. Keep your attention !
