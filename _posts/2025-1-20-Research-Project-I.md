# Project *I*: *Stgart* in the germ cells
In the research background section, you already know my research is revealing the function of lncRNAs in the mouse spermatogenesis. 
There are uncountable lncRNAs in the testis. How we know which one is supposed to be functional. In 2013, our group reported three germ cell-specific coding genes, *Prss42/Tessp-2*, *Prss43/Tessp-3* and *Prss44/Tessp-4* are essential for germ cell survival during meiosis in the mouse testis. Those three serine protease genes are paralgous to a *Prss/Tessp* loci located on the chromosome 9. Since this *Prss/Tessp* is vital for spermatogenesis, we are questioning the function of intronic region of this locus. Later, Three lncRNAs, *HSVIII*, *Tesra* and *(Start)*Stgart** were found on this loci. In 2021, **Stgart** is found by my senior, Kai Otsuka. He found **Stgart** is a regulator of steroidogenesis and this work was published in the Endocrinology. (Testis-Specific, Long Noncoding RNA, Start, Is a Regulator of Steroidogenesis in Mouse Leydig Cells. *Front. Endocrinol*. 12:665874.)

I took over this whole work after he graduated from HU. What else can I do ? 
From RNA-seq data of **Stgart**-WT and **Stgart**-KO mice, it is shown that the expression of *Prss43/Tessp-3* and *Prss45/TESPL* were decreased in the **Stgart**-KO testis.This data is telling us one truth, the **Stgart** might be a positive regulator of *Prss43/Tessp-3* and *Prss45/TESPL*.

## What's the clue for next investigation ?
The point is the subcelluar localization of itself. *In situ* hybridization showed **Stgart** was expressed in the all spermatogenetic cells. Specifically, it had strong signals in the nucleus of late pachytene spermatocytes. Thinking about the gene expression regulation events in the nucleuse, the transcription is the first event that comes to the mind. **Stgart** showed an enhancer activity for the TK promoter in the GC-2 cells. This cell lines are derived from spermatocytes and it is a good cell model to learn germ cells. The result suggested that **Stgart** can activate the transcription of luciferase gene which is driven by a TK (Thymidine kinase) promoter and **Stgart** actually can transcribe itself.

Consistently, the **Stgart** konckdown(KD) experiments showed that **Stgart** transcript can target *Prss43/Tessp-3* and *Prss45/TESPL* promoters and regulate their transcription. This work uncovered the function of **Stgart** in the germ cell that **Stgart** can target the promoters of *Prss43* and *Prss45*  and regulate their transcription.
