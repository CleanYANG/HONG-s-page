# Xashaa is a Polar molecule
29th, Jan.
Real story begun with Guava juice. My bro Ayumu told me there was a whole free guava juice to me. As a chinese person, it is a fairytale, I am taking it. I went to Bearfoot for drinking that expired free guava juice hahaha at that night. Xashaa sat by the counter alone.

I have known him for almost 4 months and we never talked so much, but I nearly kissed him in first Jan. That was an accident.

I was like : oh, hey.

We talked about that accident a little and had a great laugh. 
He asked me : "Do you like me ?"

Under the light , I looked into his eye, he was like a polar molecule creating a Dipole Moment, leading to an electrostatic attraction between him and me who is generally used to scheduale everything in my life, making me be basically a symmetrical molecule like oxygen. He just threw an eletron cloud to me and part of me was separating.

"But I will leave in xxx"

I am even more excited, I will have break-up scheduled hahah, Nice, because I am a schemer 

I open the box, the cat is Alive. He is being himself and I am being myself.

# I don't believe romantic love. But I so believe, when Xashaa hugs me, the plasma levels of my nerve growth factors NGF, BDNF, NT-3 an dNT-4 are relative high.

Nothing lasts forever, but it happens.
