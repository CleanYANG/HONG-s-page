# Project *IV* : Classification testis section by convolution neural network
This project is nothing to do with *Stgart*. This is about my eyes.
I love molecular biology but I am not big fan of making and observing tissue sections. 
I am tried of distinguishing and counting cells in the H.E stained testis section under the microscope.
My eyes are dying. One day, I come up with one idea with my dying eyes. How about I let computer do all the things that my brain does ! Classifiying and counting cells in the testis section. 
##  Now I am trying to establish image-recognizing AI model in this project and firguring the parameters for mathematical models and the construction of layers in the CNN(convolution neural network). It will be very exciting!
